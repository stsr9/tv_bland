Oxygen's hit true crime series, <i>Snapped</i>, profiles the fascinating cases of women accused of murder. Did they really do it? And, if they did, why? Whether the motivation was revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. <b>Snapped </b>is produced in conjunction with Jupiter Entertainment, the creators of <i>City Confidential</i> and <i>Dominick Dunne's Power</i>, <i>Privilege &amp; Justice</i>, and narrated by veteran news reporter Sharon Martin. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p>",

Every few days the Islanders must couple-up – those who fail to find a partner to couple up with risk being dumped from the island. Islanders are on the lookout for romance, but the road to love doesn't always run smoothly. Challenges abound with new Islander arrivals and dramatic twists as friendships and relationships form. In addition to choosing their partners wisely, Islanders must also win the hearts of viewers who have the opportunity to shape events on screen and ultimately crown one lucky couple the winner, who will then have the chance to walk away with both love and the cash prize.</p>",

Viewers will watch these couples navigate the uncomfortable and awkward moments when a past love is still front and center. Relationships, marriage and children are no longer one-size-fits-all as the couples in this series redefine the norm, break the rules and forge their own paths towards the lives and families they want and dream of.</p><p>Viewers will get a first-hand look into the unique advantages and challenges that come with having an ex be the third wheel in a relationship. We'll see one couple renew their vows with hopes of both of their exes attending, two exes get matching tattoos and one former pair living together with a new girlfriend and coexisting under one roof. Will these couples be able to juggle a third in their relationships – or will the past resurface and become too much to handle?</p>",
